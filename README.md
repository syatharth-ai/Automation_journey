# Automation Journey – Python & Practical Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

This repository documents my structured learning journey toward becoming an **Automation Engineer**. I am currently learning Python step by step and building small, practical projects every day to develop real programming and automation skills.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Track my daily learning progress  
- Practice Python concepts through hands-on projects  
- Build a strong technical foundation  
- Create a portfolio of real work instead of just certificates  

My learning approach is simple:  
**Learn → Build → Improve → Repeat**

Each folder contains the Python code and projects I built for that day.

# Automation Journey — Python & Practical Automation Projects

This repository contains my step-by-step learning journey toward becoming an Automation Engineer. It includes daily projects, Python scripts, and annotated learning logs.

## 🔹 What’s Inside
- `learning-journal.txt` – consolidated daily progress
- `day-01/` through `day-06/` – Python projects and exercises
  - Each folder contains a project I built for that day
  - Simple, clear code that demonstrates fundamental concepts

## 📌 Projects (so far)
| Day | Project | Concepts |
|-----|---------|----------|
| Day-01 | Band Name Generator | Input, strings, variables |
| Day-02 | Tip Calculator | Math operations, input/output |
| Day-03 | Pizza Order & Treasure Island | Decision making, conditionals |
| Day-04 | Rock Paper Scissors | Lists, random module |
| Day-05 | Password Generator | Functions, while loops |

## 🛠 Future Projects
I will gradually add:
- File automation tools
- API automation
- Workflow automation
- AI-powered automation tools
